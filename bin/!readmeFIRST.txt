Tip 1:
>  To drain bandwidth, it is highly recommended to divide your
>  download task into 5-10 subtasks, thus enabling parallel threads
>  + parallel processes for downloading. It should be easy to reach
>  a speed of more than two million small images per day.

Tip 2:
>  Be advised to repeat the downloading process several times to
>  reach the best overall performance. In the beginning, you should
>  use a tight #thread/survivingtime setting. Speed is your primary
>  concern. Don't worry about incomplete downloads of big images.
>  However, you need to monitor SUCC:TOUT rate. Latter, use a loose
>  setting and download again to allow slow links to complete.
